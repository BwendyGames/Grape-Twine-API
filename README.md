# Grape Twine API

 A Python server, in my case for a Twine Sugarcube integration, that connects to a hugging face "space". This is designed for chat bots, but the process is likely simmilar for any space.
 
 This is a server for [GrapeTwine](https://github.com/BwendyGames/GrapeTwine), a set of javascript widgets for Twine Sugarcube. You'll need to host your own server to use it, I used [Render](https://render.com/) but I'm sure others would work fine.
